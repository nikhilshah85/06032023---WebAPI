Todays applications : Shopping application 
With Entity Framework and sql server

Steps
1. Create a new database and add a table with sample data to the table
2. create a new WebAPI appication in Visual studio
3. Applcation does not know anything about EF, thus we will have to install nuget packages
	install 4 nuget packages in sequence
	right click solution explorer -> Manage nuget packages -> Browse 		
		Type EntityFrameworkCore

		Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools
		Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
		Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
		Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer

4. Tools -> Nuget Package Manager - Packaege manager console

Scaffold-DbContext "server=(localdb)\MSSQLLocalDB;database=shoppingAPI_DB;integrated security=true" -Provider Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer -OutputDir Models\EF

5. Check the newly created Models folder which will have EF folder and POCO classes (Plain C# Objects)
	build the application
6. Right click on controller folder, add new controller, api, Api Controller with actions useing EF 
	in the window - choose table name as Model file and database name as context file

	build the application

7. This will create the controller with all the CRUD operations, HTTPGET, HTTPPUT, HTTPPOST, HTTPDELETE

8. This used Dependency Injection by default, but we will remove it as we do not know what is DI, 
	thus instantiate new object of DBcontext 

	Line 16. 
	private readonly ShoppingApiDbContext _context = new ShoppingApiDbContext();

	Line 18 to 21
	Comment the constructor

9. Build the application and run the application, you will be able to perform all the operations not, perform the same and check the 
	table data in database server
