Try :
	implement EF Core in the same project for shoppingDB we created yesterday, 
	DB has 2 tables, and thus we will need 2 controllers

	Create the controllers with EF 
	and configure DI for the same 
		(Good news, VS will configure the DI in controller by default, u only need to to update the prog.cs)
