step 1: Create a Model of data you are going to read
	i.e Class with all the properties of data which is going to come from url
	(in our example, PostDataModel Class in Models folder with properties
step 2: Create an variable of type of data which is going to come
	 List<PostDataModel> pList = new List<PostDataModel>();

step 3: Create an Method which will read and return the data, the above variable from step 2
	
step 4 : inside the method create a new obj of HttpClient, and write the code

step 5: install nuget package 
	Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Client

step 6: create a MVC controller which will call the method from model
	in our case, SecureApiCallsController in the controller folder

step 7: import the Models folder on top 
	using HttpClientCalls.Models;

step 8 : in the action method make a call and read the data in a ViewBag
	public IActionResult PostData()
        {
            ViewBag.post = pObj.GetPostData();
            return View();
        }

step 9: Create a view, right click on PostData(), add View, Empty Razor view

step 10 : write the code in view to display the data
	<table>
    @foreach (var item in ViewBag.post)
    {
     <tr>
         <td> @item.id </td>
         <td> @item.userId </td>
         <td> @item.title </td>
         <td> @item.body </td>

     </tr>   
    }
</table>

step 11: update the layout page in shared folder 
	you need to add a new hyperlink for the new page created
	    <li class="nav-item">
                            <a class="nav-link text-dark" asp-area="" asp-controller="SecureApiCalls" asp-action="PostData">Post</a>
                        </li>

step 12: build and run the application, click on post to see the data, it should be successful

step 13: configure DI in the controller file
